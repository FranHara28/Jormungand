The ocr_handwriting.py file is an example python scrip which uses OCR to detect letter in a picture and write them out.
The ocr_homework.py file is a file that uses Tesseract OCR library and the pytesseract wrapper, it does the same thing as the ocr_handwriting.py file with the addition of turning handwritten text in the picture into string.
